# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset to uncover factors influencing booking decisions and guest behavior. The data includes information from a city and resort hotel, encompassing booking times, guest details, room types, and special requests.

Dataset Exploration:

The dataset comprises over 119,390 entries with 32 columns containing details like booking dates, guest counts, room types, and cancellation statuses. Initial analysis revealed a seasonal trend, with both hotels experiencing the most bookings in August and the least in January. City hotels consistently received more bookings compared to resorts.

Key Insights:

Seasonality: August emerged as the peak season for both hotels, with the highest number of bookings, weeknight stays, weekend stays, and car parking space requirements. Guest Preferences: Weeknight stays were generally preferred over weekend stays. Breakfast-only (BB) was the most popular meal plan across both hotels. City hotels saw a higher demand for car parking compared to resorts.

Booking Behavior: Lead time (time between booking and arrival) increased from February, peaked in July, and showed fluctuations throughout the year. Cancellations and check-outs were most frequent in August and least frequent in January. Transient guests (one-time bookers) had the highest cancellation rates, while group bookings had the lowest.

Guest Characteristics: Repeated guests (returning customers) were less likely to cancel bookings and had a higher number of previous non-canceled bookings compared to new guests. Bookings with children were more likely to include babies.

Correlations: The analysis identified some interesting correlations. Bookings with longer lead times had a slightly higher probability of cancellation. Interestingly, a higher number of special requests were associated with fewer cancellations. Guests requiring car parking were also more likely to have special requests.

Project Significance:

Understanding guest behavior and booking patterns is crucial for hotels to optimize their operations and marketing strategies. This project's insights can be valuable for:

Revenue Management: By identifying peak seasons and preferred room types, hotels can adjust pricing strategies to maximize revenue during high-demand periods.

Targeted Marketing: Analyzing guest preferences (e.g., meal plans, car parking needs) allows for targeted marketing campaigns to attract specific guest segments.

Improved Guest Experience: Understanding cancellation trends and guest behavior can help hotels develop strategies to reduce cancellations and enhance guest satisfaction.
