# Hotel Booking Analysis


Project Title:
Hotel Booking Analysis – Guest Behavior & Booking Trends
 
Problem Statement:
Analyzed a hotel booking dataset from city and resort hotels to uncover factors affecting booking decisions, guest preferences, seasonality, and cancellation behavior.

Tools Used:
* Google Colab
* Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Dataset: 119,390 rows × 32 columns

Key Insights:
* Peak Season: August had the highest bookings, weekend/weeknight stays, and car parking needs.
* Hotel Trends: City hotels had consistently more bookings and higher parking demand than resort hotels.
* Guest Preferences: BB (breakfast only) was the most popular meal plan; weeknight stays were preferred over weekends.
* Booking Behavior: Longer lead times slightly increased cancellation chances. Transient guests had the highest cancellations; group bookings the lowest.
* Guest Profile: Repeated guests canceled less and had more past non-canceled bookings. Bookings with children were often accompanied by babies.
* Special Requests Correlation: More special requests correlated with fewer cancellations and more car parking needs.

Project Significance:
* Revenue Management: Identify peak demand periods to adjust pricing strategy.
* Targeted Marketing: Use guest preferences for personalized promotions.
* Operational Planning: Anticipate cancellations and improve guest satisfaction.
